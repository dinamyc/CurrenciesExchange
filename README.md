SOLID Principles Applied with Clean Architecture

This project follows the SOLID principles and implements a clean architecture approach to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability.

SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class or module in the project has a single responsibility, meaning it should only have one reason to change. This enhances the maintainability of the codebase and makes it easier to understand and extend.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The code is open for extension but closed for modification. This is achieved by using abstractions, interfaces, and inheritance to allow new functionality to be added without altering existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. This is achieved by adhering to contracts defined by interfaces and base classes.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Interfaces should be specific to the requirements of the client. This is achieved by creating fine-grained interfaces tailored to the needs of the client, rather than large interfaces that cater to multiple clients.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. This is achieved by using dependency injection to decouple classes and modules, making them more flexible and easier to test.

Clean Architecture
The project follows the principles of clean architecture, which emphasizes separation of concerns, dependency inversion, and testability. The architecture is divided into layers:

Presentation Layer
Responsible for presenting information to the user and handling user input. Includes UI components, controllers, and presenters.

Domain Layer
Contains business logic and domain entities. This layer is independent of any specific UI framework or database technology.

Data Layer
Handles data access and storage. Includes repositories, data sources, and database access code.

Framework Layer
Contains framework-specific implementations and adapters. This layer bridges the gap between the application and external frameworks or libraries.

Rules
Each class or module should have a single responsibility.
Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
Interfaces should be specific to the requirements of the client.
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.
By adhering to these principles and following a clean architecture approach, the project aims to be maintainable, scalable, and testable, while promoting code reusability and flexibility.
